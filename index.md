## Overview
PRISMS-PF is a powerful, massively parallel finite element code for conducting phase field and other related simulations of microstructural evolution. The phase field method is commonly used for predicting the evolution if microstructures under a wide range of conditions and material systems. PRISMS-PF provides a simple interface for solving customizable systems of partial differential equations of the type commonly found in phase field models, and has 24 pre-built application modules, including for precipitate evolution, grain growth, dendritic solidification, and spinodal decomposition.

## Announcements

- 3/15/2021: New Alloy Solidification (alloySolidification) application release! This application simulates the directional solidification of a binary alloy  in the dilute limit, taking into account solute segregation, which leads to dendritic growth. The model employed [Echebarria et al., Phys. Rev. E 70, 061604 (2004)] includes an anti-trapping solute current required to correct for spurious effects that arise from considering an interface thickness much larger than the physical solid-liquid interface.
- 3/8/2021: We have uploaded new video tutorial covering the installation of prerequisited for PRISMS-PF. This video can be watched on the new [PRISMS Center YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZXc3007JuBCGKDcneD_umA) and is also available in the [Tutorials](https://github.com/prisms-center/phaseField/blob/gh-pages/pages/tutorial.md) section.
- 12/1/2020: We have uploaded new directory to the PRISMS-PF GitHub repository which includes scripts to perform processing tasks on output data files generated by PRISMS-PF. These scripts are written in Python and work in combination with the [VisIt CLI](https://www.visitusers.org/index.php?title=Using_CLI#Starting_the_CLI). Currently, we have three scripts to calculate: (1) phase fraction, (2) number of domains, and (3) area of an interface but more will be added soon. A description of each of these scripts as well as installation instructions for the VisIt CLI can be found [here](https://github.com/prisms-center/phaseField/tree/master/postprocess_scripts). 
- 11/24/2020: We have uploaded new video tutorial covering a simple example on how to set up and run a simulation for explicit nucleation and growth in PRISMS-PF. This video can be watched on the new [PRISMS Center YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZXc3007JuBCGKDcneD_umA) and is also available in the [Tutorials](https://github.com/prisms-center/phaseField/blob/gh-pages/pages/tutorial.md) section.
- 10/13/2020: We have updated PRISMS-PF to make it compatible with the latest [deal.II](https://www.dealii.org/) version (9.2.0). The main change from the previous deal.II version (9.1.2) is that now only input files with the ".prm" extension are accepted. In order to comply with that, the default name for the input file in all PRISMS-PF applications has been changed to "parameters.prm" ("parameters.in" will no longer work). After cloning the latest PRISMS-PF repository, make sure to use the correct extension for input files when creating new applications. Please report any issues [here](https://github.com/prisms-center/phaseField/issues).
- 9/25/2020: The PRISMS-PF [GUI-based nanoHUB tool](https://nanohub.org/tools/prismspfmisfit), which calculates the equilibrium shape of a precipitate particle due to anisotropic interfacial energy and misfit strain, has been updated for improved performance.
- 8/16/2020: A new video tutorial covering PRISMS-PF installation, running of a sample application and results visualization has been uploaded to the new [PRISMS Center YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZXc3007JuBCGKDcneD_umA). It is also visible in the [Tutorials](https://github.com/prisms-center/phaseField/blob/gh-pages/pages/tutorial.md) section. More PRISMS-PF tutorial videos will be available soon. 
- 8/1/2020: We are working on resolving compatibility issues between PRISMS-PF and the latest version of deal.ii (9.2.0). Until we have a working version, please use [deal.ii version 9.1.1](https://www.dealii.org/9.1.1/index.html). We will send an update when these issues are resolved.
- 6/23/2020: PRISMS-PF Docker Image Update. We have updated the PRISMS-PF Docker image to use the current version of PRISMS-PF (2.1.2). This update should solve the compatibility issues between the core library and the applications from the previous image. We have also created a [new repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/prismspf/prismspf) on Docker Hub where the new image, as well as all upcoming images, will be stored. Please follow the updated [instructions for the Docker installation](https://prisms-center.github.io/phaseField/doxygen_files/install_prismspf.html) to download and launch containers using the new image.
- 6/13/2020: New corrosion application release! This application simulates the evolution of the metal-electrolyte interface during the anodic corrosion reaction. The model employed [Chadwick et al., J. Electrochem. Soc.,10, C633-C646 (2018)] uses the phase-field and smoothed-boundary methods to track the moving metal/electrolyte interface and to couple it to mass transport (diffusion and migration) within the electrolyte and Butler-Volmer electrochemical kinetics. 
- 3/26/2020: A new open-access article titled [PRISMS-PF: A general framework for phase-field modeling with a matrix-free finite element method](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-0298-5) has been published on *npj Computational Materials*. In this article we introduce PRISMS-PF as a new open-source framework for phase-field modeling, emphasizing ease of use, flexibility and adaptability to a wide range of applications, and computational performance. We recommend this article to everyone interested in an overview of the PRISMS-PF framework and its applications. Please use this publication as the standard reference when citing PRISMS-PF. We'll keep an eye on references to that paper, but if you use PRISMS-PF in your work, please send us the citation so that we can advertise your work on the PRISMS-PF website and can pass usage information to our funding agency.
- 1/14/2020: The PRISMS Center will hold a workshop at the TMS 2020 149th Annual Meeting and Exhibition, where participants will become familiar with PRISMS software tools, including PRISMS-PF, and will gain the knowledge about when to use these tools. For more information and registration [visit this site](https://www.tms.org/TMS2020/Professional_Development/Workshops_and_Courses/PRISMS__Training_Workshop/TMS2020/pd/PRISMS_Workshop.aspx?hkey=7238a67d-383c-4223-880d-8ea3d87f4729&_zs=DiBXC1&_zl=xeeV5).
- 12/2/2019: The PRISMS Center at the University of Michigan is looking to hire a new research faculty member to lead the development of PRISMS-PF and participate in phase field research related to the center's goals.

The first three days are dedicated to hands-on training with the PRISMS codes (including a day for PRISMS-PF).

- 9/11/2018: Please take a moment to fill out the short [2018 PRISMS-PF User Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/rAp8cJAeBjqsi5ep1). The survey results will guide future PRISMS-PF development and help us justify continued funding.
- 8/21/2018: The tentative dates for the 2019 PRISMS Workshop are August 5-9 in Ann Arbor, MI.

- 8/21/2018: [Version 2.1 released.](https://github.com/prisms-center/phaseField/releases/tag/v2.1) This is a moderate-level update to v2.0.2. The structure of equations and ICs/BCs files has been updated for improved legibility and flexibility. A new grain-remapper has been introduced to handling polycrystalline simulations with many grains and a new hybrid Newton/Picard nonlinear solver has been added.
